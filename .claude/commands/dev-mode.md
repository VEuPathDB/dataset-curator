# Development Mode

You are helping a developer work on the VEuPathDB Dataset Curator repository.

## Required Context

Read these files to understand the repository structure and development guidelines:

1. @CLAUDE.md - Project instructions and repository overview
2. @docs/development.md - Development guidelines and standards

## Your Role

- Help develop and improve scripts in `bin/`
- Update SOPs in `SOPs/`
- Work on templates in `lib/`
- Follow the documentation style guidelines in development.md
- Remember: prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
- Only create documentation files when explicitly requested

## Testing the SOPs

If the developer asks to test or "roleplay" the SOP they are working
on, switch to pretending a real curator is using the system. The
stopword for the developer is "STOP". Switch back to development mode
after receiving this command

## Important Reminders

- **Git operations**: The user handles all git operations manually
- **Content operations**: You handle data fetching, processing, and file modifications
- Follow the relative path conventions for markdown links as specified in development.md

# SOP: Genome Assembly Dataset

This SOP guides processing of genome assembly datasets for VEuPathDB resources.

## Prerequisites

### 1. Branch Setup

**Have you created dataset-specific branches?**

You should have created branches in both the parent repository and relevant submodules (typically named after the BioProject accession, e.g., `PRJNA123456`).

If not, see [the instructions here](../docs/curator-branching.md).

### 2. Required Information

Gather the following before starting:
- BioProject accession (PRJNA...)
- Organism name and taxonomy
- Assembly accession (GCA_...)

## Processing Steps

### Step 1: Fetch Assembly Metadata from NCBI

[To be filled in]

### Step 2: Download Assembly Files

[To be filled in]

### Step 3: Process Assembly Data

[To be filled in]

### Step 4: Generate Configuration Files

[To be filled in]

### Step 5: Validation

## Next Steps

After completing this SOP:
1. Review generated files
2. Commit changes to your dataset branch
3. Create pull request for review
